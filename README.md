Our project for the FitchGroup Codeathon aimed to streamline and automate the fleet management process for UCAN Chicago by developing a comprehensive car rental system using Microsoft Power Automate and SharePoint. We designed an intuitive, automated workflow that simplifies vehicle requests, approvals, and returns, allowing UCAN staff to efficiently manage their fleet, track allocations, and ensure smooth communication between employees, managers, and facility teams.
